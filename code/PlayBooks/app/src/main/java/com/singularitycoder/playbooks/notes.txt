Grant Notification permission
If you want the notification non-dismissable by the user, pass true into the setOngoing() method when you create your notification using Notification.Builder.

TTS:--------------------------------------------------

https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech.java
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech

Max speech input is 4000 - get max length from TextToSpeech.getMaxSpeechInputLength() as per AOSP source
TTS pitch value varies from 25 to 400, where 100 is the value for normal * pitch. The max pitch value is set to 400
Speech rate. 1.0 is the normal speech rate, lower values slow down the speech (0.5 is half the normal speech rate), greater values accelerate it (2.0 is twice the normal speech rate).

https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2009/09/introduction-to-text-to-speech-in.html

String myText1 = "Did you sleep well?";
String myText2 = "I hope so, because it's time to wake up.";
mTts.speak(myText1, TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH, null);
mTts.speak(myText2, TextToSpeech.QUEUE_ADD, null);

the first speak() request would interrupt whatever was currently being synthesized: the queue is flushed and the new utterance is queued, which places it at the head of the queue. The second utterance is queued and will be played after myText1 has completed.
